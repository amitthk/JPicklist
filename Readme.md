# JPicklist

What is this?

This is a simple Jquery based Picklist which can be used to display Picklist of items for selection. It can also be used for display of hierarchical data in a picklist.

The first example in this source code shows list filtered by Alphabets.

The second example shows a sample hierarchical data (filtered by Month then Date and then selectable time slots)
